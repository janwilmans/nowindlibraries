We will try to create regular stable release labels from now on (aug. 2011). Use the head source code at your own risk (will not damage anything, but might not work as expected.) I you are just getting started or want things to 'just work' try the binary windows release first, when that works, you at least know the Interface is working correctly and cables etc. are Ok. After that you can use the source code from the latest release label. See [Browse Source](http://code.google.com/p/nowindlibraries/source/browse/) to see what the latest release label is.
